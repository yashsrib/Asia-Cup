# Asia-Cup
It contains the files related to the asiacup project where we predict the result of match using different variables.
Using the asia cup dataset, the following tasks were performed:
- first the data visualization was done.
- then we checked if there are any null values or duplicates.
- then the data was prepared/ preprocessed to be used for machine learning models.
- and lastly, we tried various models to make predictions and selected the best one based on scores.
